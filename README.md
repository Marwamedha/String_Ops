### functions
#### you can use f(s): 
for a given nonempty string s find a minimum substring t and the maximum number k, such that the entire string s is equal to t repeated k times. 
#### you can use is_palindrome(s): 
for checking the string is palinrome or not 
#### you can use solve(a,b): 
You will be given two strings a and b consisting of lower case letters, but a will have at most one asterix character. The asterix (if any) can be replaced with an arbitrary sequence (possibly empty) of lowercase letters. No other character of string a can be replaced. If it is possible to replace the asterix in a to obtain string b, then string b matches the pattern . If the string matches, return true else false.
#### you can find_nth_occurrence()
You can find the nth occurrence of a word in text using this method.
